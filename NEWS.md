# robust v0.7-1 (2022-07-08)

-   Sfloat and Sint are now deprecated, see mail of Prof Riplay from
    08.07.2022 typedef-s inserted in robust.h

# robust v0.7-0 (2022-02-01)

-   Replace the call to the deprecated function covMest() by a call to
    CovMest() (package ‘rrcov’), which returns an S4 object

-   Code using S.h is converted to use R.h

-   BLAS - Fix for USE_FC_LEN_T becoming the default in 4.2.0 (early
    notification)

# robust v0.6-1 (2021-11-16)

-   Fixed error on Solaris

# robust v0.6-0 (2021-10-24)

-   Fixed an error due to not explicitly including R_ext/Error.h -
    include this file implicitly in compatibility.c.
-   Fixed: everything related to ‘covfm’ was moved to package fit.models
    (actually I only commented the exports in NAMESPACE and a couple of
    other references. All the code remains duplicated in robust, also
    the RD files)

# robust v0.5-0 (2020-03-08)

-   New submission, maintainer Valentin Todorov
